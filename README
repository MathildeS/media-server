|-- server.js : the entry point of the media collector. reads the requests are process them ("search" function) by calling functions in mediafinder.js

|-- mediafinder.js : the main function of the media collector module. It lists the available services in "var services" and then, depending on the call made, it will call diverse combination of these services. 

|-- services : contains the files coresponding to the calls to the diverse services. The name of each file makes sense. 

|-- global-config.js : contains all the developper keys used to access the diverse apis. Other global configuration details are stored here. 

|-- package.json : specifies dependencies and describes the module

|-- micropostCollection.js : a utility file for collecting and sending results. Also includes a "spotlight" and a "translate" functions, but they are not used in the current project

|-- svChannels.js and rbbChannels.js : the white lists for each provider. channels are youtube channels ids, and services are the services that should be called (from the white list)

|-- freshMedia.js : list of fresh media servies called when using the "freshMedia" call

|-- step.js, uris.js, twitterScrapers.js, cleanMessages.js : utility files
